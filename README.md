Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing , testing and maintaining software.
-Software engineering is reliable as it performs as expected.
-Flexible in that it can handle an increased load.
-Efficency in a way that it helps to optimise developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
-security implements protection practice like authentication


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Mastering complexity
-mastering process
-mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-planning stage this is like laying the foundation for a house, it defines the project goals.
-Design stage where you design how the software will look like.
-Development stage which is also known as the coding stage.
-Testing stage which is crucial to ensure your software works perfectly.
-Deployment stage which is thw launching stage.
-maintenance stage where you fix bugs, add new features


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology is like a linear flow, one step finishes before the next starts 
while
-Agile methodology is more flexible in that it focuses on small, rapid cycles. agile is like building a lego house, one piece at a time

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-software developer
*plans the process by which the software will be developed
*ensures that the activities are followed as planned
*writes codes to bring the project to life.

-A quality Assurance Engineer
*adds new features to the software
*ensures that the software is up to date

-A project manager
*guides the team through challenges
*keeping everyone on the same page 
*finding solutions when things go wrong


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Intergrated development Environments(IDEs) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing space to write, compile, and debug codes.
-Importance of IDEs
*they can make suggestions to complete a code
*they increase programmer productivity
*the compile or convert code into simplified language

-Version Control Systems(VCS) are software tools that help software teams manage to source code overtime eg GIT
Importance of VSC
*collaboration
*change trackin
*branching and merging
*error recovery


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Rapid tecnological advancement
- -software security
- changing software requirements
- -limited infrastructure
- insufficient funds

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit tests*

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
IMPORTANCE
*improved user experience as it makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
*Developer control, prompt engineering gives developers more control over user's interactions with AI.
*Increased flexibility, a prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

*Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

*Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.

*Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

*Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
